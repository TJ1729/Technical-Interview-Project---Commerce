=== Anaplan Technical Interview Project Submission ===

-=- About -=-
I completed this project as part of an online course "CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript"
 on harvard.edu. A summary of the specification:
> Design an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids
 on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist”.
> Create a set of (at least 3) models (classes) to describe this website.
> Have pages that:
	- displays all active listings
	- displays details of a specific listing (with comments)
	- displays a user's watchlist
	- displays all categories
> Has a functional Django admin interface

-=- What To Review -=-
The most relevant files to review for this postion would be under "auctions\models.py" and
 "auctions\views.py", which are entirely in Python. The HTML templates are located in
 "auctions\templates\auctions" and can provide additional interest. There is unfortunately no CSS in this
 project since using Bootstrap framework for this project was significantly easier and quicker (and permitted).
I can provide a project with JavaScript interacting with Django if preferable, although it is considerably
 smaller in scope.

-=- Testing -=-
The only requirement to run the site locally is Python installed on your computer - navigate command prompt to
 where the main folder is on your computer and run "python manage.py runserver" - you can then navigate the site locally
 in-browser. All users "admin","Homer","Bart","Lisa", and "Marge" of the example database have a password of "123".

Thankyou for your time & consideration,
Tim
